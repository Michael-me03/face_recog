# face_recog
This project is being implemented as a student project to explore the use of facial recognition in contactless payments. 

For this purpose, an application is being developed that will automatically process contactless payments using facial recognition. A transaction will then be automatically created and later posted via Stripe. 

For facial recognition, another GitHub repository will be accessed, which is used under the following license.
